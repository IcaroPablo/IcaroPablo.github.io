	    <p> What's there to say ? I'm a normal guy from Brazil that likes tinkering with software here and there, casually making little projects like this one, in fact I'm a software developer interested in old, simple and elegant stuff.</p>

	    <p>I tend to use free software alternatives whenever I can and I'm also a retrogames and retrocomputing enjoyer so, if you want to make me any sugestion on what to play next in my not-so-old Nintendo 3ds (that I actually use to play GBA games), feel free to <a href="mailto:ic4ro.p4blo@gmail.com" target="_blank">mail me</a>.<p>
